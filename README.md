## Overview

The MultiviewX dataset dedicates to multiview synthetic pedestrian detection. Using pedestrian models from [PersonX](https://github.com/sxzrt/Dissecting-Person-Re-ID-from-the-Viewpoint-of-Viewpoint), in Unity, we build a novel synthetic dataset MultiviewX. It follows the [WILDTRACK dataset](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-wildtrack/) for set-up, annotation, and structure.

The MultiviewX dataset is generated on a 25 meter by 16 meter playground. It has 6 cameras that has overlapping field-of-view. The images in MultiviewX dataset are of high resolution, 1920x1080, and are synchronized. To fully exploit the complementary views, calibrations are also provided in MultiviewX dataset.

## Toolkits for MultiviewX dataset.

This repo includes the toolkits and utilities for bulding MultiviewX dataset.
 
How to's
- download (from [link](https://anu365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/u6852178_anu_edu_au/EZ9hISq6FxBItIsdIDkapmUBGIK7Fn9LVIAuUT8NltKDBw?e=atMYbI)) and copy the 2d/3d bbox annotations into `/matchings`.
- run the following command.
```shell script
python run_all.py
```
- done.

## Evaluation

For multiview pedestiran detection, MultiviewX follows the same evaluation scheme as Wildtrack with MODA, MODP, precission, and recall. Evaluation toolkit can be found [here](https://github.com/hou-yz/MVDet/tree/master/multiview_detector/evaluation).
